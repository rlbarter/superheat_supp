# Supplementary materials for "Superheat: Supervised heatmaps for visualizing complex data" by Rebecca L Barter and Bin Yu

The communities and crime datasets for Figures 3 and 4 can be found at [the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime+Unnormalized). Unfortunately the fMRI data for Figures 6 and 8 is not publicly available, but we have provided voxel location and cluster data so the interested user can recreate voxel_loc.gif.

The voxel_loc.gif can be viewed at [here](http://rlbarter.github.io/superheat_supp/) and is displayed below:
