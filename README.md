# Supplementary materials for "Superheat: Supervised heatmaps for visualizing complex data" by Rebecca L Barter and Bin Yu

The communities and crime datasets for Figures 3 and 4 can be found at [the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime+Unnormalized). Unfortunately the fMRI data for Figures 6 and 8 is not publicly available, but we have provided voxel location and cluster data so the interested user can recreate voxel_loc.gif.

The voxel_loc.gif can be viewed [here](http://rlbarter.github.io/superheat_supp/) and is displayed below. The orange spheres correspond to the voxels in the second cluster of Figure 8, while the grey spheres correspond to the voxels in the first cluster of Figure 8.
